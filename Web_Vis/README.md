Requires the .wav files available as mp3's at the VAST 2018 Mini-Challenge 1 data: https://vacommunity.org/VAST+Challenge+2018+MC1
Contact me for .wav files if you can't convert them yourself. They should be saved in a folder titled: All_Birds_WAV.
When converting keep the same title for each sound, just change it to wav.
